## Description

- Health care app helps users track their fitness progress

## Problem

- The goal is to develop a straightforward yet feature-packed tracking app that provides users with clear, intuitive charts to monitor their progress, alongside a user-friendly and easily navigable interface.

- From a development perspective, the codebase should maintain a clean separation between the user interface (UI) and business logic. The project structure should follow best practices to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability. Moreover, all libraries used must be simple, secure, and easy to integrate.
